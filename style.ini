; To extend this file or make changes to it, it is recommended to create
; a local conf/tpl/<template-folder-name>/style.ini file to prevent losing
; any changes after an upgrade.
; Please don't forget to copy the section your changes should be under
; (i.e. [stylesheets] or [replacements]) into that file as well.

; Define the stylesheets your template uses here. The second value
; defines for which output media the style should be loaded. Currently
; print, screen and all are supported.
; You can reference CSS and LESS files here. Files referenced here will
; be checked for updates when considering a cache rebuild while files
; included through LESS' @import statements are not

[stylesheets]
css/basic.css               = all
css/design.css              = all

; This section is used to configure some placeholder values used in
; the stylesheets. Changing this file is the simplest method to
; give your wiki a new look.
; Placeholders defined here will also be made available as LESS variables
; (with surrounding underscores removed, and the prefix @ini_ added)
